If you lookin' at your man, and he look like a scarecrow
(You need a) Superhero, superhero
He actin' all tough like Robert De Niro?
(You need a) Superhero, superhero
Add it all up, he still equal to zero
(You need a) Superhero, superhero
I'm comin' to arrest you, I'm comin' to the rescue
(You need a) Superhero, superhero




It's a bird, it's a plane, nigga stronger than a train
That bitch Bruce Wayne better stay in his lane
Boy, I spit flame like a dragon
Watch how they actin', when they rеlease the Krakеn
You know, save everything but a hoe
Yo momma won't let go off the jiggalo
She call me a Marvel, you a D.C. comic
Yup, straight-up retardo
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped the Avengers, picked up my ninjas
Knocked the door off the hinges
Fuck the cowboys, down with the Indians
Blacker than a panther
If this was Wakanda, I'll spit the anthem
I only got a villain as a friend
You know his name bitch, MC Ren, let's go




If you lookin' at your man, and he look like a scarecrow

(You need a) Superhero, superhero
I'm comin' to arrest you, I'm comin' to the rescue

Your homeboys hate you, I'mma violate you
Give you that motherfucking broken bottle facial
This ain’t racial, your new name is Rachel
Got niggas in the pen, that might wanna date you
I underrate you, then annihilate you, like that fuckin' therapist that said I had a breakthrough
This is what I live for, this is called survival
All my rivals are dead on arrival




This is a revival, better bring your Bible
These lyrics are something, you might wanna die for
I'm not libel, nigga I’m the dope
Nope, that's a typo, nigga I'm the pope
West coast cycle, on a motorcycle
Dressed like Michael, it ain't Halloween
My city is so mean, I'm Idi Amin
I'm the baker's man, got the cake, got the cream
The undertaker man, from Laygaland
The world is my toy, like Legoland
The old man in the van looking for his puppy
Do you wanna help me, you Tinder young guppie?
The big fish gotta eat, don't interrupt me
The ones who got away, are oh so lucky
The only thing found most of the time is a huffy
You pretty young thing, it’s about to get ugly






See, my pen is mightier than my AK
And my enemies won't have a good day
See, my pen is mightier than my AK
And my enemies won't have a good day




Blow they ass away
Put 'em on layaway
Fuck their whole world up with the shit I say
Fuck their whole life up with the shit I write
It's a shark in the water, do you feel the bite?




See, my pen is mightier than my AK
And my enemies won't have a good day
See, my pen is mightier than my AK
And my enemies won't have a good day
