# Python Final Project: Rap Lyrics Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates text processing and analysis techniques using Python tools. The analysis focuses on rap lyrics from multiple albums, incorporating data cleaning, tokenization, word frequency analysis, category analysis, and visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter (for local execution)

## Installation and Setup

### Local Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/migue456456/rap_lyrics_analysis.git
   cd rap_lyrics_analysis
   ```

2. Install required packages (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

### Google Colab Execution
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file or connect to your GitHub repository
3. Run the first cell to automatically set up the environment

## Data Description
- **Lyrics Data**: Contains raw text files of rap albums by Ice Cube
- **Categories**: Predefined word categories (e.g., weapon, murder, beat) for analysis

## Analysis Features
- Loading multiple albums into a corpus
- Text cleaning and tokenization
- Word frequency analysis
- Category analysis (custom categories)
- Visualizations with Plotly (top words, category comparison)
- Modular code organization with reusable functions

## Key Learning Objectives Demonstrated
- File I/O and text processing in Python
- Text cleaning and tokenization with regex and spaCy
- Word frequency and category-based analysis
- Data visualization using Plotly
- Object-oriented programming with classes
- Environment compatibility (local vs. Colab)

## Usage
Run all cells in `notebook.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook will:
1. Set up the environment automatically
2. Load raw lyrics from data_raw/
3. Clean and tokenize the lyrics
4. Perform statistical and category analysis
5. Generate visualizations of top words and categories
6. Optionally save cleaned text to data/cleaned_lyrics/
